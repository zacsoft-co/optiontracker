        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <div class="effective-date">Last Updated: Jun 13, 2025</div>

        <h2>Your Privacy Matters to Us</h2>
        <p>At OptionTracker, we believe your trading data is deeply personal. That's why we've designed our app with privacy at its core. We don't collect, store, or have access to your trade data - it stays safely on your device and syncs through your personal iCloud account.</p>
        <p>This privacy policy explains exactly what limited information we do handle and how we protect you.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>What We Don't Collect</h2>
        <p>We don't collect any personal information, such as:</p>
        <p>• Your trade data (stays on your device and in your personal iCloud)<br>
        • Your personal information (name, email, phone, address)<br>
        • Your financial account details or brokerage information<br>
        • Your browsing habits or app usage patterns<br>
        • Your location or device usage analytics</p>
        <p>Your trading activity is completely private to you.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>What We Do Collect (Very Little!)</h2>
        <p>We only collect the absolute minimum needed to provide our service:</p>
        <p>• Subscription Information: RevenueCat (our payment processor) handles subscription status and uses device identifiers for payment processing. We never see your payment details.</p>
        <p>• Bug Reports & Feature Requests: Only when you voluntarily submit feedback through our app. You choose what to share and can include your email for follow-up (completely optional).</p>
        <p>That's it! We don't collect any other data about you or your usage.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Your Trade Data is Yours Alone</h2>
        <p>Your trade information is stored:</p>
        <p>• Locally on your device using SwiftData (Apple's secure data framework)<br>
        • In your personal iCloud account (if you enable iCloud sync in iOS Settings)</p>
        <p>Important: iCloud sync is a direct relationship between you and Apple. We (OptionTracker developers) cannot access your iCloud data. Apple encrypts and protects your data according to their privacy policy, not ours.</p>
        <p>When you delete the app, all your local trade data is automatically removed.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Third-Party Services We Use</h2>
        <p>We work with trusted services to provide our app:</p>
        <p>• RevenueCat: Handles subscription management and payment processing. They process minimal device information needed for subscription validation.</p>
        <p>• Apple iCloud: Syncs your data across your devices.</p>
        <p>• Firebase Firestore: Stores bug reports and feature requests you voluntarily submit (with appropriate security rules).</p>
        <p>Each service has their own privacy policies and security measures.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>How We Protect Your Privacy</h2>
        <p>We've implemented several privacy protections:</p>
        <p>• No Analytics: We don't track how you use the app<br>
        • Local Storage: Your trade data never leaves your devices<br>
        • Minimal Data: We only handle what's absolutely necessary<br>
        • Secure Submissions: Bug reports use encrypted connections with validation rules<br>
        • No Third-Party Sharing: We never sell or share your information</p>
        <p>We believe in privacy by design, not privacy by policy.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Your Rights and Control</h2>
        <p>You have complete control over your data:</p>
        <p>• Delete Everything: Uninstall the app to remove all local data<br>
        • Control iCloud Sync: Enable/disable in iOS Settings > [Your Name] > iCloud<br>
        • Optional Feedback: Only share bug reports if you choose to<br>
        • Contact Us: Reach out with any privacy questions</p>
        <p>Your data, your choice, always.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>No Data Retention Issues</h2>
        <p>Since we don't collect your trade data, there's nothing for us to retain or delete:</p>
        <p>• Trade Data: Stored only on your devices and personal iCloud<br>
        • Subscription Data: Managed by RevenueCat as required for payment processing<br>
        • Bug Reports: Stored securely for app improvement purposes</p>
        <p>Delete the app anytime to remove all local data instantly.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Updates to This Policy</h2>
        <p>If we ever need to change this policy, we'll let you know through an app update. Since we collect so little data, changes would likely be minor clarifications.</p>
        <p>Your continued use of the app means you agree to any updates.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Questions? We're Here to Help</h2>
        <p>Privacy questions are important, and we're happy to answer them:</p>
        <p>Email: <a href="mailto:hello@zacsoft.co" class="contact-email">hello@zacsoft.co</a></p>
        <p>We'll respond promptly and clearly. Your privacy matters to us, and we want you to feel confident using OptionTracker.</p>
